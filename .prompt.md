Implement a patient deletion feature by:

1. Add a "Delete Patient" button with appropriate warning confirmation dialog to:
   - Patient detail view page
   - Patient edit page 
   - Patient manager action menu dropdown

2. Update the backend patient view controller to:
   - Create a DELETE endpoint that accepts a patient ID
   - Implement proper error handling and validation
   - Return appropriate HTTP status codes (200 for success, 404 if not found)
   - Log deletion events for audit purposes

3. Ensure the UI:
   - Shows loading state during deletion
   - Handles errors gracefully with user feedback
   - Redirects to patient list view after successful deletion
   - Updates any relevant patient counts or lists

4. Add appropriate access control checks to restrict deletion to authorized users only

Technical requirements:
- Follow existing UI component styling and patterns
- Add unit tests for new functionality
