- Consolidate duplicate JavaScript functions
- Ensure retained scripts follow AdminLTE's recommended practices

3. Code Organization
- Restructure remaining code following AdminLTE's architectural patterns
- Implement consistent file naming and directory structure
- Group related components and utilities logically
- Add appropriate code documentation and comments

4. Layout Preservation Requirements
- Maintain responsive grid system across all breakpoints
- Preserve theme consistency including colors, typography, and spacing
- Ensure all interactive elements remain functional
- Validate layout integrity on mobile, tablet, and desktop views

Deliverables:
1. Detailed removal plan with affected file paths
2. Impact assessment for each proposed change
