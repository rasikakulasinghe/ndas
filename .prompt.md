Develop an optimized video processing pipeline using Celery and Redis for distributed task management. The pipeline should:

1. Accept an original video file as input
2. Analyze the video metadata (format, duration, resolution, codec)
3. Implement efficient video conversion with the following requirements:
   - Target format and codec specifications
   - Desired resolution and bitrate settings
   - Performance metrics to measure conversion speed
   - Error handling and retry mechanisms
   - Progress tracking capabilities

Technical constraints:
- Use Celery for task queue management
- Implement Redis as the message broker
- Define memory and CPU usage limits
- Specify supported input video formats
- Document expected output formats
- Include logging and monitoring requirements

Optional enhancements:
- Multi-worker configuration
- Batch processing capabilities
- Compression quality settings
- Thumbnail generation
- Parallel processing options

Please provide specific video processing requirements and infrastructure details for a more tailored implementation.
