Analyze and resolve issues with AdminLTE template integration in the project:

1. Review the current implementation that uses local AdminLTE files:
   - Document working components and features
   - Identify template version and dependencies
   - List all custom modifications

2. Migrate to AdminLTE CDN implementation:
   - Use official AdminLTE CDN (https://adminlte.io/docs/3.2/)
   - Update all template references to CDN versions
   - Maintain version consistency across all dependencies
   - Verify required plugins are included

3. Debug and fix migration issues:
   - Compare file paths and asset references
   - Check browser console for script/style loading errors
   - Verify CSS/JavaScript load order
   - Ensure all required CDN endpoints are accessible
   - Test responsive layouts and interactive components

4. Re-implement any broken functionality:
   - Document each issue found
   - Fix asset loading sequences
   - Restore custom modifications
   - Test across multiple browsers
   - Validate template responsiveness
   - Remove unnecessary custom offline files related to AdminLTE
