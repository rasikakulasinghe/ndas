Update the add.html template and its associated view function in Django to:

1. Integrate with the modified Django model structure
2. Implement video file handling with the following requirements:
   - Check uploaded video file size
   - If size exceeds 25MB, trigger video conversion process
   - Display conversion progress on a separate page
3. Ensure video upload workflow:
   - Accept video file upload
   - Process file size validation
   - Show upload progress
   - Redirect to conversion progress page after successful upload
4. Apply AdminLTE template components and styling:
   - Use AdminLTE card layout for the upload form
   - Implement progress bars for upload/conversion status
   - Follow AdminLTE form styling guidelines
   - Maintain responsive design

Technical Requirements:
- Use Django's Form handling
- Implement async video processing
- Store conversion progress in session/database
- Follow AdminLTE 3.x theming structure

Expected Output:
- Updated add.html template with AdminLTE styling
- Modified view function with video processing logic
- Proper error handling and user feedback
- Seamless integration with existing Admin interface
