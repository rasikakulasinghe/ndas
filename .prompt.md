Implement video upload functionality with the following requirements:

1. Update the add video page form fields to match the Video model attributes
2. Implement create/update view function that:
   - Validates video file format and size
   - Handles file upload with multipart/form-data
   - Displays real-time upload progress using AJAX/WebSocket
   - Stores uploaded file in configured media storage

3. Video Processing Flow:
   - After successful upload, redirect to /videos/process/<video_id>
   - Use Celery task queue with Redis backend to:
     - Extract video metadata (duration, resolution, codec)  
     - Generate thumbnails at specified intervals
     - Convert video to web-optimized formats (MP4/H.264), with maintaining original or near original quality
     - Update processing status in database
   - Display processing progress with status indicators
   - Auto-refresh progress page until complete
   - Redirect to /videos/<video_id> when processing finishes

4. Technical Requirements:
   - Configure Celery workers and Redis message broker
   - Implement progress tracking using Celery task events
   - Handle errors gracefully with user feedback
   - Follow async task best practices
   - Add appropriate logging
   - Include retry logic for failed tasks
