Please review and fix the non-functioning dropdown menus in the main sidebar navigation. Specifically:

1. Check the sidebar menu component code for:
   - Event listener implementation
   - Toggle state management 
   - CSS class applications for show/hide behavior

2. Verify these technical requirements:
   - Menu items have proper aria-expanded and aria-controls attributes
   - Parent menu items correctly reference their dropdown content
   - Click and keyboard events are properly handled
   - CSS transitions/animations are working as expected

3. Review browser console for any JavaScript errors

4. Provide the following code samples for investigation:
   - Sidebar menu component
   - Dropdown trigger implementation
   - Associated CSS for menu states
   - Any related initialization scripts

Please indicate which framework/library is being used (e.g., Bootstrap, custom implementation) as this affects the debugging approach.
