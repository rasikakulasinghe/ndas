Please perform a code analysis of the 'add.html' file and its associated view function, specifically focusing on the patient addition functionality. The issue to investigate is that GMA (Geriatric Medicine Assessment) indicators are not being properly added during patient registration.

Tasks:
1. Review the form submission logic in add.html
2. Examine the view function handling the patient addition
3. Verify the GMA indicator fields are:
   - Present in the HTML form
   - Properly captured in the form submission
   - Correctly processed in the view function
   - Successfully saved to the database
4. Check for any validation errors or missing field mappings
5. Test the form submission process with GMA indicators
6. Implement necessary fixes to ensure GMA indicators are properly saved

Expected outcome:
- Working patient registration with complete GMA indicator storage
- Proper validation and error handling
- Consistent data persistence

Please provide the relevant code sections and any errors encountered during testing.
