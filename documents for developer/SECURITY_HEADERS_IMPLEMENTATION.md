# Security Headers Implementation Documentation

## What Was Added

The following security headers and configurations have been added to `ndas/settings.py`:

### Security Headers Implemented

1. **SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER = True**
   - Enables XSS protection in browsers
   - Helps prevent Cross-Site Scripting attacks

2. **SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF = True**
   - Prevents browsers from MIME-type sniffing
   - Stops browsers from interpreting files as different MIME types

3. **SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS = 31536000**
   - HTTP Strict Transport Security for 1 year
   - Forces HTTPS connections for the specified duration

4. **SECURE_HSTS_INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS = True**
   - Applies HSTS to all subdomains
   - Ensures comprehensive HTTPS enforcement

5. **SECURE_HSTS_PRELOAD = True**
   - Enables HSTS preload list inclusion
   - Browsers will enforce HTTPS even on first visit

6. **X_FRAME_OPTIONS = 'DENY'**
   - Prevents the site from being embedded in frames/iframes
   - Protects against clickjacking attacks

7. **SECURE_REFERRER_POLICY = 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin'**
   - Controls what referrer information is sent with requests
   - Enhances privacy and security

### Cookie Security Settings

1. **SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY = True**
   - Prevents JavaScript access to session cookies
   - Protects against XSS cookie theft

2. **CSRF_COOKIE_HTTPONLY = True**
   - Prevents JavaScript access to CSRF tokens
   - Enhances CSRF protection

3. **SESSION_COOKIE_AGE = 3600**
   - Sets session timeout to 1 hour
   - Reduces risk of session hijacking

4. **SESSION_EXPIRE_AT_BROWSER_CLOSE = True**
   - Sessions expire when browser is closed
   - Prevents session persistence on shared computers

### Production HTTPS Settings (Currently Commented Out)

These settings are commented out for development but should be enabled in production with HTTPS:

```python
# SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = True  # Redirects HTTP to HTTPS
# SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True  # Only send session cookies over HTTPS
# CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True  # Only send CSRF cookies over HTTPS
```

## How to Enable HTTPS Settings for Production

1. Set up SSL certificate on your server
2. Uncomment the three HTTPS settings in settings.py:
   ```python
   SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = True
   SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True
   CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True
   ```
3. Test thoroughly to ensure HTTPS is working correctly

## Testing the Security Headers

You can test if the headers are working by:

1. Running the development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

2. Using browser developer tools to check response headers

3. Using online tools like:
   - Security Headers scanner (securityheaders.com)
   - SSL Labs SSL Test (ssllabs.com/ssltest/)

## Additional Security Recommendations

1. **Keep Django Updated**: Regularly update to the latest Django version
2. **Use HTTPS in Production**: Essential for the security headers to be effective
3. **Content Security Policy**: Consider adding django-csp for CSP headers
4. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
5. **Input Validation**: Ensure all user inputs are properly validated

## Files Modified

- `ndas/settings.py`: Added security headers configuration

## Next Steps

1. Test the application to ensure headers are working
2. Plan HTTPS deployment for production
3. Consider implementing Content Security Policy
4. Review and fix CSRF exemptions in views
5. Implement proper input validation across the application
